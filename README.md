# Hackers Mini Poster

This is a scan of a mini poster for the 1995 movie Hackers. It seems to have originally been some sort of promotional material in some larger packet or product box.

There are three sizes of the file. A small 637x1000 PNG, a medium 1273x2000 PNG, and a full size 7732x12143 PNG.

The file size of the full scan is too large to upload to Github as a single file, and so has been broken into 10M chunks.

To reconstruct the full size scan, run the following:

```bash
$ cat high_res_scan_cropped.part.?? > high_res_scan_cropped.full.png
```

The resulting file `high_res_scan_cropped.full.png` is now the full size scan.
